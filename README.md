# LIKAS

LIKAS is an offline-first Android biodiversity fieldwork and reference tool for Philippine wildlife surveys.

**Active development branch:** `feature/likas-core-fieldwork-post-rc4`  
**Current development preview:** `0.27.3-rc49-history-review-preview` (versionCode **109**)  
**Application ID:** `org.phwildlife.survey.beta08`  
**SQLite schema:** **27**

**Build status (30 October 2026):** RC49 History/observation review merged in PR #46 at `c35426e3a820c2cc4658c022fe7b626a5cc0b3ca`. PR Scientific Core QA **41028714285** passed **316 Python tests**, JVM tests, app and AndroidTest APK compilation. Merged-branch push CI **41028923966** passed with signed APK artifact **12964408568**. The independently inspected code109 APK is **9,781,724 bytes**, SHA-256 `270e18bc2efd3207cd6f1779bc377be11f39a1841402f7e6df781267ff79fcb9`, with correct package/version and a valid APK v2 signature/digest under the original certificate SHA-256 `f7c471ad310aeeffd2b2a7cf7c371c6efdce258560a818b52be5e1f2a7509937`. Development preview only: installed upgrade and real-device accessibility checks are not complete.

## What LIKAS currently provides

- **Fieldwork:** birds, amphibians/reptiles and mammals, project and station records, GPS/elevation, observations, effort, survey history and analysis. A survey can end as **Complete**, **Incomplete**, or **Not Counted**.
- **Library:** the full offline Philippine species checklist plus **96** curated illustrated research accounts, **15** habitat profiles, cited species/ecology references and approved offline photographs. Global IUCN and Philippine DENR statuses appear only when independently reviewed and dated. Unreviewed statuses stay neutral.
- **Settings:** backup/recovery, storage, import, integrity checks and Less motion.

The research/news feed and comprehensive ecological atlas remain planned features. Reference associations never create field observations.

## Development and QA

**RC48 Home and Fieldwork integration:** The RC47 shared components now serve survey setup and observation inputs. Active surveys have a dedicated Current survey section; narrow-phone capture actions reflow without removing the pinned End Survey dock. See [RC48 field UI QA](docs/LIKAS_RC48_HOME_FIELDWORK_QA.md) and [RC47 design foundations](docs/LIKAS_RC47_DESIGN_SYSTEM_FOUNDATIONS.md).


The current scientific build workflow is [`.github/workflows/core-science-qa.yml`](.github/workflows/core-science-qa.yml). It automatically runs on application/source changes and checks source contracts, evidence, database identity, pinned signing identity, photo rights, JVM unit tests, and APK compilation. Documentation-only changes do not trigger builds. Superseded runs are canceled.

Two slower device workflows are **manual acceptance checks**:
[`library-android-smoke.yml`](.github/workflows/library-android-smoke.yml) and
[`rc7-device-emulator-qa.yml`](.github/workflows/rc7-device-emulator-qa.yml). Their source and baseline requirements must be checked before running. An APK build alone does not establish handset compatibility.

Do not add APKs, keystores, local caches, emulator captures or generated photo-review packs to Git. These are covered by `.gitignore`. Signed APKs belong in short-lived CI artifacts and verified, direct conversation downloads.

Historical release decisions, original source records, scientific review ledgers and approved imagery remain in `docs/`, `app/src/main/assets/` and Git history. The obsolete v0.15 installation instructions have been removed from this README, not from version history.
