# LIKAS

LIKAS is an offline-first Android biodiversity fieldwork and reference tool for Philippine wildlife surveys.

**Active development branch:** `feature/likas-core-fieldwork-post-rc4`  
**Current source candidate:** `0.27.3-rc41-field-readiness-preview` (versionCode **101**)  
**Application ID:** `org.phwildlife.survey.beta08`  
**SQLite schema:** **27**

**Build status (30 October 2026):** RC41 signed development APK was verified from Scientific Core QA run **40908133636**, code commit `8d2918665eccd8d6a037d616cd58a9a9dde6cf96` (package `org.phwildlife.survey.beta08`, versionCode **101**, original signing certificate). This is not yet production/field-accepted. Physical upgrade, survey-retention, restoration, and emulator checks remain unverified. Follow direct-download policy for an actual APK file, not a GitHub artifact link.

## What LIKAS currently provides

- **Fieldwork:** birds, amphibians/reptiles and mammals, project and station records, GPS/elevation, observations, effort, survey history and analysis. A survey can end as **Complete**, **Incomplete**, or **Not Counted**.
- **Library:** the full offline Philippine species checklist plus **96** curated illustrated research accounts, **15** habitat profiles, cited species/ecology references and approved offline photographs. Global IUCN and Philippine DENR statuses appear only when independently reviewed and dated. Unreviewed statuses stay neutral.
- **Settings:** backup/recovery, storage, import, integrity checks and Less motion.

The research/news feed and comprehensive ecological atlas remain planned features. Reference associations never create field observations.

## Development and QA

**Next revision in review:** Owner-approved 18-icon green pixel-art set is locked in `docs/LIKAS_ICON_ASSET_LOCK_2026_10_30.md`. The `Custom Survey` creation menu is removed in the proposed feature branch, but archived custom survey records remain readable. Neither the new PNGs nor this change are included in the verified signed RC41 APK yet.


The current scientific build workflow is [`.github/workflows/core-science-qa.yml`](.github/workflows/core-science-qa.yml). It automatically runs on application/source changes and checks source contracts, evidence, database identity, pinned signing identity, photo rights, JVM unit tests, and APK compilation. Documentation-only changes do not trigger builds. Superseded runs are canceled.

Two slower device workflows are **manual acceptance checks**:
[`library-android-smoke.yml`](.github/workflows/library-android-smoke.yml) and
[`rc7-device-emulator-qa.yml`](.github/workflows/rc7-device-emulator-qa.yml). Their source and baseline requirements must be checked before running. An APK build alone does not establish handset compatibility.

Do not add APKs, keystores, local caches, emulator captures or generated photo-review packs to Git. These are covered by `.gitignore`. Signed APKs belong in short-lived CI artifacts and verified, direct conversation downloads.
